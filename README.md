[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucldc/pynux.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ucldc/pynux)

python function library for working with nuxeo "REST" APIs.

## Install / Upgrade with `pip`

master branch can be installed with

```
pip install https://github.com/ucldc/pynux/tarball/master --upgrade
```
We'll try to keep `master` stable, but for the latest release see https://github.com/ucldc/pynux/releases/latest , or this might work

```
pip install $(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/ucldc/pynux/releases/latest | jq -r '.tarball_url')
```

its possible you might need a latter day `pip`

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## install code

checkout code and install 

```
git clone https://github.com/ucldc/pynux.git
cd pynux
pip install .
```

### test
```
python setup.py test
```

## Configuration

To configure pynux, you will need to create a file named `.pynuxrc`. You can use a simple text editor to create the file. In a Windows OS, the file should be placed in `C:\Users\Username\`. In a Mac OS, the file should be placed in `~/.pynuxrc` (open a terminal window and type `open .` for the correct location).   

It may be advisable to `chmod 600 .pynuxrc`.

The following is an example default configuration that can be copied-and-pasted into the `.pynuxrc` file:

```ini
[nuxeo_account]
user = Administrator
password = Administrator

[rest_api]
base = https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/Nuxeo/site/api/v1 
X-NXDocumentProperties = dublincore
# for developers on the UCLDC project; use
# X-NXDocumentProperties = dublincore,ucldc_schema,picture

[ezid]
host = https://ezid.cdlib.org/
username = 
password = 
shoulder = ark:/99999/fk4
```

alternative authentication
```ini
[nuxeo_account]
method = token
X-Authentication-Token = xxxxxxx
```

## Custom Function

```python
# foo.py
def nuxeo_mapper(docs, nx):
    for doc in x:
        print(doc)
        # can use `nx.`... to update the document
```

```
nxls.py / --show-custom-function foo
```
